Dec 02 16:00:16 <Deja-Fu>	wireless still unavailable, wifi hotkey on keyboard still toggles "hard blocked" for phy0 but not for hp-wifi as shown by RFKill
Dec 02 16:01:08 <broken6r>	sudo lsmod, put it in hastebin

Dec 02 16:03:34 <Deja-Fu>	based on the output of inxi -n, I believe "rt2800mmio" is what it thinks is controlling the wireless card
Dec 02 16:03:44 *	ultr4_l4s3r has quit (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
Dec 02 16:04:30 <Deja-Fu>	oh, I guess it would be rt2800pci
Dec 02 16:05:01 <broken6r>	what i dont get is how the physical wifi card says intel on the thing, the lspci says otherwise
Dec 02 16:05:28 <broken6r>	makes no sense
Dec 02 16:05:53 <broken6r>	we have told it to try to load the driver for that intel card and nothing
Dec 02 16:06:14 <Deja-Fu>	yeah that's what weirded me out
Dec 02 16:06:14 <broken6r>	are you booting any other operating systems?
Dec 02 16:06:27 <Deja-Fu>	nope, nuked windows 8 completely before installing solus
Dec 02 16:06:39 <Deja-Fu>	I suppose somebody could have slapped the wrong sticker on the card
Dec 02 16:06:44 <broken6r>	and wifi has never worked in linux?
Dec 02 16:06:49 <broken6r>	possible but unlikely
Dec 02 16:06:58 <Deja-Fu>	nope, wifi hasn't worked at all
Dec 02 16:07:06 <Deja-Fu>	this is the first time I've tried linux on this computer though
Dec 02 16:07:38 <broken6r>	paste the output of ifconfig in hastebin
Dec 02 16:08:05 <Deja-Fu>	with or without -a?  It doesn't show the wireless unless I use -a
Dec 02 16:08:31 <broken6r>	both
Dec 02 16:09:04 <Deja-Fu>	ok, with -a: https://hastebin.com/qidirefehi.sh

Dec 02 16:10:12 <broken6r>	also, how are you trying to connect to wireless
Dec 02 16:10:24 <Deja-Fu>	just the normal settings app
Dec 02 16:10:39 <Deja-Fu>	wifi is shown as off, I can click the toggle switch but it makes no difference
Dec 02 16:11:33 <broken6r>	doubtful, but if you right click the network icon in the budgie taskbar is wifi checked or unchecked

Dec 02 16:13:11 <Deja-Fu>	it responds with that block of info but doesn't change anything
Dec 02 16:13:52 <broken6r>	and no shown networks by single left clicking the network icon in budgie?
Dec 02 16:14:08 <Deja-Fu>	right, just the ethernet connection
Dec 02 16:14:26 <Deja-Fu>	there's a grayed-out line of text under "Wifi Networks" that says "Wi-fi is disabled"

Dec 02 16:17:46 <Deja-Fu>	so I think the modprobe change had some effect
Dec 02 16:17:54 <Deja-Fu>	didn't notice that until now

Dec 02 16:19:48 <broken6r>	"Hard blocked" cannot be changed by software, look for a wifi toggle on your keyboard or edges of the laptop; the device can also be hard blocked if disabled in the bios.

Dec 02 16:20:07 <broken6r>	and?
Dec 02 16:20:14 <broken6r>	toggle it and rfkill list all again
Dec 02 16:20:15 <Deja-Fu>	when I hit it, it changes the "hard blocked" status of the phy0 interface, but never the hp-wifi

Dec 02 16:21:35 <broken6r>	frustrating
Dec 02 16:22:21 <broken6r>	the only other thing i can say is either wait for one of the dev's to come online, or report an issue at https://dev.solus-project.com/ and link all of those hastebin's along with a good description of what is happening

Dec 02 16:22:47 <Deja-Fu>	yeah, I was going to make a forum post
Dec 02 16:22:58 <broken6r>	thatd be another way to go as well
Dec 02 16:23:11 <Deja-Fu>	thanks for your help, at least now I have info to show people 
Dec 02 16:23:17 <broken6r>	make sure you explain the difference between the lspci and what is on the physical wlan card
Dec 02 16:23:22 <Deja-Fu>	will do
