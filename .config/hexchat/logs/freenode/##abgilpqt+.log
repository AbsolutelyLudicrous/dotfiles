Oct 02 17:05:06 <qaqaplpl>	anyone online?
Oct 02 17:05:14 <macksting[m]>	Somewhat
Oct 02 17:05:20 <macksting[m]>	o/
Oct 02 17:05:56 <qaqaplpl>	this is my first time trying IRC
Oct 02 17:06:15 <macksting[m]>	Oh! Welcome to the neighborhood.
Oct 02 17:06:17 <qaqaplpl>	anything I should know
Oct 02 17:06:23 <macksting[m]>	Me mum got me into IRC when I was 12 or so.
Oct 02 17:06:33 <qaqaplpl>	nice
Oct 02 17:06:38 <qaqaplpl>	where are you from?
Oct 02 17:06:53 <macksting[m]>	Um. Gosh. I've been using just whatever client I can bother to find for so long... I'm from the Pacific Northwest of the US.
Oct 02 17:07:23 <qaqaplpl>	Okay. Nice. I am from India.
Oct 02 17:07:28 <macksting[m]>	Frankly, at this point I'd almost think *I* could use some pointers.
Oct 02 17:07:35 <macksting[m]>	My knowledge is probably quite dated.
Oct 02 17:07:56 <qaqaplpl>	are you an AI?
Oct 02 17:08:20 <LordRyan>	Everyone on IRC is a bot except you.
Oct 02 17:08:21 <macksting[m]>	Best thing I can figure? Entropy can be fought, but eventually spoils any system's order and goodliness, so enjoy any good place you can while it lasts, fight against corruption and cruelty, and be ready to move on and just enjoy the good times you had if it all goes sour.
Oct 02 17:08:27 <macksting[m]>	Nah, I'm a human.
Oct 02 17:09:02 <qaqaplpl>	what?
Oct 02 17:09:06 <macksting[m]>	I know that all sounds very general, but it's how I interact with IRC.
Oct 02 17:09:45 *	qaqaplpl (~Malachi@123.201.168.152) has left ("Leaving")
Oct 02 17:09:50 <macksting[m]>	...
Oct 02 17:09:55 <macksting[m]>	Did I scare them?
Oct 02 17:10:41 <macksting[m]>	I swear, I'm entirely incapable of casual conversation. lolshrug
Oct 02 17:12:00 <LordRyan>	Usually casual conversation doesn't attempt to lead to existential crisis.
Oct 02 17:12:50 <macksting[m]>	Then they're doing it wrong! http://existentialcomics.com/comic/204
Oct 02 17:12:52 -Euforia/##abgilpqt+-	Title: Existential Ad Agency - Existential Comics (at existentialcomics.com)
Oct 02 17:20:19 <macksting[m]>	Wait, no, this one. http://existentialcomics.com/comic/178
Oct 02 17:20:21 -Euforia/##abgilpqt+-	Title: Door to Door Existentialism - Existential Comics (at existentialcomics.com)
Oct 02 17:21:13 <macksting[m]>	"Sure, but do you ever feel an aimless anxiety about the weight of your choices in a short, meaningless life?" "Well, to be honest, sometimes..." "You see, through the teachings of existentialism, we can help you. You'll never have to not feel that way again." "Wait, did you say 'never have to NOT feel that way?'"
