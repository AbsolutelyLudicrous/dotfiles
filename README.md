Know all those nifty hidden files that determine cool behaviour?  That's this repo.  Meant to work on GNOME/Budgie Desktops, but should work across all ZSHes and Neovims.

TODO:

	add Conky configs

	add Plank configs
	
	add an install script
	
	actually pretty much just add everything in ~/.config
